# suntime

I have a favorite time of day when the sun illuminates the area around my house.

I created this program to build me a calendar file when the sun is at my favorite position.

*Usage:*

{
% ~/bin/suntime.py --latlong 47.608013 -122.335167  --altitude 20 --timezone US/Pacific --elevation 174
2021-01-24 16:12:54.832778-08:00
}
